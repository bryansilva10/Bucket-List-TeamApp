<!--Page to display bucket list. 
Default: Dynamically display bucket list items, button to edit list, completed items at the bottom?
Bucket list item:
      Check box, item
Edit list: 
      Dynamically display current list as forms with onchange 
      methods which add the modified item to a list of items to update
      serverside unless they are already on it. New items do not need 
      this OnChange method. 

      Button to add item. Items added are added to list to be added 
      serverside.

      Each list item, including added ones, should have a delete checkbox
      next to it. Checked items are moved to the bottom of the list and 
      crossed out. On submit, checked items are sorted. Preexisting items 
      that are being deleted are added to a delete list and removed from 
      all other lists that they might be on. Items added during this edit 
      session are simply removed from all lists.
Check Item:
      Move item to the "completed" section?
